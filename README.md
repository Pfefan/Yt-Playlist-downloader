# Yt-Playlist downloader

A small program that allows you to download with little effort a list of playlists in the form of audio files, 
which are then stored in a structured way that you can keep them apart.

If you add new songs to your playlist and sync them in the same folder, only the new songs will be downloaded and the already downloaded songs will not be affected.
